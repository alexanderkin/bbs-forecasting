#Various factoids

On North American climate
There has been an increase in mean temperature in North America since the 1980's (pg. 90, fig 2.7)   
Redmond, Kelly T., and John T. Abatzoglou. "Current climate and recent trends." Climate Change in North America. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 53-94.  

Predictions for the next 10-20 years are uncertain (Meehl et al 2014) but models currently suggest a continued trend in warming, with potential for short term decreases (natural variability around increasing trend)(fig 3 & 4, Kumar et al 2014)

#Forcasting
People should do a better job at forecasting.

#SDM references

GBM's are one  of the best models for SDM's (Elith et al 2006) but JSDMs could potentially be better (Warton et al 2015)
